What's new in vkd3d 1.7.1
=========================


*** libvkd3d

- Release 1.7 has a bug that causes an internal mutex in its command
  queue implementation to be unlocked too early under certain usage
  patterns. This is known to further cause internal inconsistencies
  that manifest as program deadlocks for some programs. In release
  1.7.1 the mutex is correctly kept locked until required.

*** libvkd3d-utils

- Symbol D3D12CreateDevice is mistakenly not exported in release 1.7,
  breaking library clients that need it. The symbol is exported again
  in release 1.7.1.
